foo.bar challenges:  a secret hiring process by Google to recruit programmers and developers. 

While I was doing some searches on Google homepage, I received an invite via a prompt like this:

By clicking on Yes, I was catapulted into a UNIX-like shell with a limited sequence of commands. 

The goal is to solve five levels, each level can have one or more challenges. 

To enter a level and start a challenge, there is the _request_ command. 

You can propose your solution in Python or Java. There are two _solution_ file and, depending on the coding language chosen, you must edit the corresponding file with the _edit filename_ command.

To test if your solution is correct and without errors, the _verify filename_ command runs some test cases and shows the results of your solutions (note that the tests are hidden). 

Finally, to submit your solution there is the _submit filename_ command.
